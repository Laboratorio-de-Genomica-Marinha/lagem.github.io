### $whoami
I'm a ocean dynamicist and educator in Oceanography at [USP](https://www5.usp.br). Originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://www.scripps.ucsd.edu">Scripps Institution of Oceanography), University of California San Diego. Prior to joining USP, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](www.whoi.edu) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [UConn](www.uconn.edu).

I'm interested in ocean and climate physics, geophysical fluid dynamics and open science.
