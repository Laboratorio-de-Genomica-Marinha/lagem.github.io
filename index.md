I'm an oceanographer and educator at [Universidade  de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br), in Brazil.  I'm interested in ocean and climate physics, geophysical fluid dynamics and open science.

Originally from São Paulo and a graduate of USP, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), University of California San Diego. Prior to returning to USP as faculty, in 2023, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu) (2018-2020) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu) (2020-2023).
