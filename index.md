I'm an oceanographer and educator at [Universidade  de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br). Originally from São Paulo, Brazil, and a graduate of USP, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://www.scripps.ucsd.edu), University of California San Diego. Prior to returning to USP as faculty in 2023, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](www.whoi.edu) (2018-2020) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [University of Connecticut](www.uconn.edu) (2020-2022).

I'm interested in ocean and climate physics, geophysical fluid dynamics and open science.
