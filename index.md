I'm an ocean dynamicist and educator in Oceanography at [University of Sao Paulo](https://www5.usp.br). Originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://www.scripps.ucsd.edu">Scripps Institution of Oceanography), University of California San Diego. Prior to joining USP in 2023, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](www.whoi.edu) (2018-2020) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [University of Connecticut](www.uconn.edu) (2020-2022).

I'm interested in ocean and climate physics, geophysical fluid dynamics and open science.
