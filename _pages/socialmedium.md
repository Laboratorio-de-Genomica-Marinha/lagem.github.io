 One of my heroes, Henry Stommel, wrote in his autobiography:
 
>The discoveries that take place at the 
blackboard are usually marked by sudden inspiration. After all, the blackboard
is a social medium, at least two persons are involved, and they get tired
standing before it. This means that  the blackboard sessions are relatively
short.  

We live in weird times.  An increasing number of academics confuse posting and browsing on social media with work.  I believe we, as scientists and professors, do not need Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. Certainly not for work. (Let institutions take care of outreach.) More than ever, we need synchronous, preferrably in person, truthful social interactions, at seminars, at coffee time,  and at the board. In  those interactions, learning happens. And there lie the seeds of new discoveries.

Below are a few snapshots of my favorite social media.

    <small>I recently crossed the street with two Oceanography doctoral students. By crossing the street I mean going to the Math Department, which houses the best outdoor blackboards I've ever found anywhere in the world. We discussed the beta = 0 solution in Stommel's seminal 1948 paper, a solution we hardly see in course notes or textbooks. I particularly like this problem because it gives me an opportunity to talk about a few math tricks to avoid tedious algebra.</small>

    <small>In 2021 I replaced the old whiteboard in my UConn office with a blackboard (a high
    quality Quartet chalkboard). This is the last boardwork on the old
    whiteboard from a weekly check-in meeting with Ph.D. student Paban Bhuyan. 
    On it, a Fourier series from a teaching session with Paban and some brainstorming 
    of tasks for Paban's dissertation. On the top left, two quotations 
    to keep us humble. They paraphrase messages on Feynman's last board.</small>

    <small>This is a picture I took in Summer 2015 from a blackboard at the back of the main room at Walsh Cottage, which house the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Program every Summer since 1959. The board filled up with scribbles of equations over a few days of brainstorming sessions among several people, some of the brigthest scientists I've ever met. The topic of 2015 GFD Summer Program, of which I was a fellow, was Stochastic Processes in Atmospheric and Oceanic Dynamics.</small>

We found this green one at sale for USD 50 at the UCSD Surplus Store, a real bargain. This is our first session at this chalkboard, in which we discussed the so-called Nakamura method for estimating an effective difussivity.
