 One of my heroes, Henry Stommel, wrote in his autobiography:
 
>The discoveries that take place at the 
blackboard are usually marked by sudden inspiration. After all, the blackboard
is a social medium, at least two persons are involved, and they get tired
standing before it. This means that  the blackboard sessions are relatively
short.  

We live in weird times.  An increasing number of academics confuse posting and browsing on social media with work.  I believe we, as scientists and professors, do not need Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. Certainly not for work. (Let institutions take care of outreach.) More than ever, we need synchronous, preferrably in person, truthful social interactions, at seminars, at coffee time,  and at the board. In  those interactions, learning happens. And there lie the seeds of new discoveries.

Below are a few snapshots of my favorite social media.

    <small>I recently crossed the street with two Oceanography doctoral students. By crossing the street I mean going to the Math Department, which houses the best outdoor blackboards I've ever seen anywhere in the world. We discussed the beta = 0 solution in Stommel's seminal 1948 paper, a solution we hardly see in course notes or textbooks. I particularly like this problem because it gives me an opportunity to talk about a few math tricks to avoid tedious algebra.</small>

    <small>I recently replaced the old whiteboard in my office with a blackboard (a high
    quality Quartet chalkboard). This is the last boardwork on the old
    whiteboard from a weekly check-in meeting with Ph.D. student Paban Bhuyan. 
    On it, a Fourier series from a teaching session with Paban and some brainstorming 
    of tasks for Paban's dissertation. On the top left, two quotations 
    to keep us humble. They paraphrase messages on Feynman's last board.</small>

    relationship between vorticity and angular velocity (the classical
    example of the distortion of an infinitesimal material line by a laterally 
    varying flow). On the right, the boardwork from an office hours session with a 
    student in my undergrad course, in which we did a quick-and-dirty
    estimation of sea-level rise 
    due to continental ice melt.</small>

some GFD. In this session, we briefly discussed PV conservation in the single-layer
