Richard Feynman:

> The first rule is not to fool yourself --- and you are the easiest person to fool.

> Never confuse education with intelligence. You can have a Ph.D. and still be an idiot. 

Russ Davis (quoted by Chelton in the Russ Davis Memorial Symposium):

>Don't read a lot of papers. Most of them are worthless. 

>Those clowns have turned this into a cottage industry.

Lev Landau (quoted by Narlikar and Burbidge in Facts and Speculations in Cosmology):

>Cosmologists are often wrong but never in doubt.
